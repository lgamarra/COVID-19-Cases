COVID-19-Cases in The United States and Territories vs Worldwide

The data being reviewed for this project shows COVID-19 cases worldwide from January 20, 2020 through June 1, 2020. However, this data analysis project does a comparison of positive case in the United States and Territories with other countries.

The main comparisons are:
- Positive cases in the US and Worldwide
- Recovered cases in the US and Worldwide
- Deaths in the US and Worldwide

After doing the analysis, I came to the conclusion that positive cases in the United States were significantly higher than all countries combined. However, testing was widely available in the United States in comparison to the rest of the world at the beginning of the pandemic. In addition, while "Positive" cases were a lot higher than "Recovered" cases, the analyst that initially studied the data referred other analysts to an article from Nate Silver with Five Thirty Eight about how positive COVID-19 cases need to be taken with a grain of salt.
